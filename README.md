# black-and-white-othello

Please implement a basic Othello game with the following functionality:

- An 8x8 game board rendered using Chakra UI components 
- Black and white circular pieces
- Clicking on an empty square places a piece of the current player's color
- When a piece is placed, any opponent pieces in a straight line (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) between the new piece and an existing piece of the current player's color are flipped to the current player's color
- Players alternate turns, starting with black
- The game ends when the entire board is filled
- A "Start new game" button clears the board

Don't worry about enforcing legal moves or keeping score for now, I will add that later. The important part is rendering the board and pieces and allowing pieces to be placed.
